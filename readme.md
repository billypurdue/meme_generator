## Motivation

Whene Meme Captain went away I needed an easy way to keep generating memes with Hubot (although truthfully it wasn't me, it was my coworkers who were complaining about it).  I found the old meme_generator coffee script in an abandoned hubot scripts repository on github, fixed it up, and here it is.
